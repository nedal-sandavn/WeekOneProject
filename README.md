# WeekOneProject
Week One Project for frontend course with @alzahranihind
this is a simple website that collects twenty-three links from different websites in order to **facilitate the writer's writing currency**.
It has three classifications in it:
-Writing tools
-git back **passion**
-Idea generator

I used the **HTML** language that I learned this week, and I will return to it again to amend and improve it.
